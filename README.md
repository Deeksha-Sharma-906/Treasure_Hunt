# Treasure_Hunt
An interactive grid-based Treasure Hunt game built with Python and Tkinter, designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts.

# 🗺️ Treasure Hunt Game (Python + Tkinter)

A simple yet fun **Treasure Hunt Game** built with **Python, Tkinter, and Random**.  
This project was created as part of my **Python revision journey (Day 2)** — a lightweight but interactive way to revise **functions, UI programming, and game logic**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The player starts at the **top-left corner** of a grid-based map.  
A **hidden treasure** is placed randomly on the grid, and the player must **find it within limited moves**.  

- ✅ Choose map size: 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, or 10x10  
- ✅ Move using buttons: **Up, Down, Left, Right**  
- ✅ Limited moves depending on map size  
- ✅ Treasure revealed if found (or when the game ends)  
- ✅ Restart option included

## 🧑‍💻 Code Concepts Revised
This mini-project refreshes key Python concepts:  
- Functions & scope (`global variables`)  
- Event-driven programming with **Tkinter**  
- UI components: Labels, Buttons, Frames, Radiobuttons  
- Conditional checks & loops  
- Randomization with the `random` module
